## Advanced Targets
- Kernel Programming (C/C++/CUDA) for optimization
- optimization techniques for model performance enhancements, including quantization, distillation, sparsity, streaming, and caching.
- Integrate and tailor frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, DeepSpeed, and FSDP to advance super-fast model training and inference.
- Advance the deployment infrastructure with MLOps frameworks such as KubeFlow, MosaicML, Anyscale, and Terraform, ensuring robust development and deployment cycles.
- AI training job scheduling, orchestration, and management via SLURM and Kubeflow.
